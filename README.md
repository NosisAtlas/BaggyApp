# BaggyApp
Front End React Project

This code defines a React application using "react-router-dom" to manage navigation between different pages of the application. It imports various components for the pages, including "Home", "Details", "Login", "Register", "Account", and "Create".

The application uses a Router component that defines the different routes of the application. Each route corresponds to a different page and is defined using the Route with an "exact path" property to specify the URL associated with the page and an "element" property to specify the component associated with the page.

The application also has "Header" and "Footer" components that will be displayed on all pages. The message "Veiller changer vers branche master pour voir le code" means "Please switch to the master branch to see the code."
